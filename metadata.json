    "Description": "PredMS classifies compounds as metabolically stable (\u226550% remaining at 30\u2009min) or unstable (<50% remaining at 30\u2009min) in human liver microsomes. The model was trained on an in-house dataset of 1917 compounds (1049 stable and 868 unstable), and validated on a external test dataset of 61 compounds.",
